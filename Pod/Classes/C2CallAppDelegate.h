/** Application Delegate base class for an automatic initialization of C2Call services.

As a VoIP and Messaging Service the C2Call Framework requires a complex initialization procedure and as well a detailed monitoring of all application states like active (app is in foreground), inactive (screensaver is active), background (app is in background) or termined. During the different states, the C2Call Framework has to maintain the connection to the C2Call backend systems, monitor network changes, automatically retrieve missed messages or call records and nevertheless save battery power as good as possible. In order to make it easy for the developer, all this complex application management has been capsuled into the C2CallAppDelegate base class. This base class should now be the UIApplicationDelegate base class for apps using the C2Call Framework.
 
 The C2CallAppDelegate class implements the following methods from UIApplicationDelegate:
 
    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
    - (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application;
    - (void)applicationWillResignActive:(UIApplication *)application;
    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application handleOpenURL:(NSURL *)url;
    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation 
    - (void)applicationWillTerminate:(UIApplication *)application;
    - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken
    - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:(NSError *)error
    - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo
    - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveLocalNotification:(UILocalNotification *)notification
    - (void)applicationDidEnterBackground:(UIApplication *)application
    - (void)applicationWillEnterForeground:(UIApplication *)application

 On all methods above the corresponding super method has to be called when overwriting in your own C2CallAppDelegate subclass.

        In order to use photo effects with the C2Call SDK, please add the following library from the 3rdparty-libs folder:
        R1PhotoEffectsSDK.a and add the CoreText Framework to your application.
 
        In your project target settings, add the parameter "-ObjC" to "other Linker Flags".

 it will be presented to the user. The Application has the chance to restore the network connections then and present 
 a custom notification to the user.

 The standard Login and Registration Controler stores the email address and password in the NSUserDefaults. C2CallAppDelegate will automatically use them next time on application start for an automatic login.
 For a new application development it is recommended to use the standard login and register controls to create test accounts before implementing an individual login and registration process.
