/** C2CallPhone - Base class for low-level C2Call phone and messaging API.

 This class provides the low-level API methods for major C2Call communications features:
    - Phone calls to PSTN and mobile phone networks,
    - VoIP and video calls,
    - Group calls (voIP and Video)
    - Instant Messaging,
    - SMS / Text Messages
    - Rich Media Messages like photo, video, voicemail, location, etc.
 
 This class also provides the core functionality to start and stop the C2CallPhone and handle the background behavior.
 The C2CallAppDelegate uses this Class in order to initialize the connection to the C2Call service and to handle the background status of the app.
 
 Example call functionality:
 
    // Call the C2Call TestCall
    [[C2CallPhone currentPhone] callVoIP:@"9bc2858f1194dc1c107"];
 
 Example messaging functionality:
 
    // Send an SMS / Text message
    [[C2CallPhone currentPhone] submitMessage:@"Hi, this is an SMS" toNumber:@"+1408234123456"];

 
 Example Rich Messaging Functionality:
    #import <SocialCommunication/UIViewController+SCCustomViewController.h>
    ...skip...
    [self captureImageFromCameraWithQuality:UIImagePickerControllerQualityTypeMedium andCompleteAction:^(NSString *key) {
        [[C2CallPhone currentPhone] submitRichMessage:key message:@"Hi, see my photo..." toTarget:@"max@gmail.com"];

    Country     : Country of the User. If nil, will be determined automatically.
    CountryCode : Default country code. If nil, will be determined automatically.
 
 The Country and CountryCode parameter is very important to differentiate between local and international phone numbers.
 Typically users have phone number in local format in their phone book. In order to convert those numbers correctly in international format which is required by the service,
 the the SDK needs to know the users home country and country code.
 For user registration with phone number (like WhatsApp or other apps doing it) please use numberVerificationForRegister method first to request a PIN.
 Fill the Phone and NumberPIN fields then. As email address you may use a generic address like phonenumber@domain (domain must be a valid email domain) or nickname@domain.
 The NumberPIN must be valid, otherwise registration fails.

 Only the group members are able to decrypt messages and attachements. Attachments and messages are stored encrypted on the servers and will be automatically decrypted on the group members device.
