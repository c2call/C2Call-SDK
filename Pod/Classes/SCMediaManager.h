/** The SCMediaManager class is the shared instance for managing video capture sessions.
 
 The SCMediaManager class can be controlled by the application in order to hook into a video capture session during a video call and to receive the captured frames for further processing like face recognition.
 The C2Call SDK video call subsystem uses this class to request a capture session and register a AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate. 
 Up to two AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate can be registered for a video capture session.
 It's important that any additional video frame processing should be fast enough to allow a smoth video call with 10 - 20 frames per second. 
 Video frames consume a lot of memory. Please don't forget to run a profiler session on any additional video processing in order to detect potential memory leaks.
